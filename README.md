![Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0c8f4c7-f3de-4097-a3cb-63b5da377ccc)

The front-end of a task management web app that uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, each change logged to the console log in JSON.

## Project Description

Unicorn Flow is a task management app that features a pastel rainbow color palette and a cute logo to bring joy to any to-do list in a fun and gamified way! This project is the culmination of what I learned in my WEB 110 - Webscripting class at Wake Technical Community College. For our final project we were tasked with creating the frontend dvelopment and web design for a task management web application using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

### Required Features

These are the features that were required by our professor for our final project:

**Functional Requirements**

- Input field where users can enter a task name
- Dropdown menu to select task priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Checkbox for marking a task as important
- Users should be able to submit tasks via a form
- Checkbox for marking a task as completed (or done)
- Users must be able to toggle task completion
- Submit button to add the task to the list
- Delete button to remove the task to the list
- Users must be able to delete tasks
- Date to show when the task was added using the Date object
- Div with an id of "taskmanager" using .innerHTML where tasks will be displayed dynamically
- Important tasks must be highlighted in red
- Completed tasks must have a strikethrough
- Tasks must be stored in an array of objects with the following properties and logged in the console in JSON:

```
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Finish JavaScript project",
  priority: "High",
  isImportant: true,
  isCompleted: false,
  date: todayï»¿
  }

```

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Application must be coded using vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks)
- Code must follow clean coding practices, including proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments
- UI should be responsive and visually intuitive
- Application must prevent invalid input, such as empty task names

### Fun Features

These are the features that I added to enhance user experience:

- <ins>Confetti:</ins> Whenever a task is completed, confetti falls down the screen to add an element of gamification and adds to the overall feeling of joy I want users to feel when using Unicorn Flow
- <ins>Modal Form:</ins> The form users fill out to add tasks is in a modal that appears only when users need to add a new task and disappears when the user is finished entering their new task to create a more clean and uncluttered user interface 


## Building Unicorn Flow

I first started developing Unicorn Flow in April 2025 and it took me about 2 weeks to build. After reading the requirements and watching the example video provided as a jumping off point, I started first with the development to make sure I hit all of the functional requirements, then moved onto the design and how I wanted my task management web app to look. Here is the example video we were provided:
